# scene-editor2
Rework of SceneEditor

## Abstract
This is a temporary repository for the rework of the SceneEditor project from AngularJS to modern Angular.
Over years many dependencies become deprecated and new technologies developed.

After rework the code will be moved (probably) to the SceneEditor repository unless it is proved to be impractical.

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/github/VJigouline/scene-editor2)

## Rework targets

`The targets maybe are too ambitious to achieve, but let try to do the best.`

1. Convert code from AngularJS to modern Angular
2. Split code into reusable NPM packages
3. Improve architecture and make it more flexible and reusable
4. Rework GUI
5. Make it reusable as application framework for future projects

## List of actions

1. Attempted to create Azure Static Web Application (SWA). Failed with message  
>Node.js version v18.20.8 detected.  
>The Angular CLI requires a minimum Node.js version of v20.19 or v22.12.
Sounds like Azure SWA doesn't support latest Node.js.
